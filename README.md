# Unified Neural Spike-Amplitude Theory  
### Open Research Release  
Version 1.0

This repository presents two scientific documents:

1. **SPIKE_MODEL.md**  
   A unified model explaining blindsight, hemineglect, age-related memory loss,
   attention-dependent memory formation, and failure of artificial eyes to
   generate conscious perception or memory. The theory is based on cortical  
   surface-tension regulated spike amplitude.

2. **NEURAL_SAFETY.md**  
   A technical warning document describing why infrared-spectrum “artificial
   eyes” and direct visual cortex stimulation may cause irreversible cortical  
   damage, cancer risk, and complete failure of memory formation.  

   This document outlines safety principles and minimum requirements for any  
   neural-implant project.

## Why This is Important

Modern neural prosthetics focus on injecting visual signals into the cortex
without reproducing:
- attentional gating  
- amplitude thresholds  
- hippocampal indexing  

This repository outlines foundational neuroscience principles necessary to  
prevent catastrophic long-term neural damage and to enable actual perception  
rather than raw signal injection.
