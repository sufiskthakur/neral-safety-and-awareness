Unified Spike-Amplitude Theory of Awareness and Memory  
Version 1.0

This document describes a unified neural principle explaining:
- Blindsight  
- Hemineglect  
- Age-related memory loss  
- Attention-specific memory failure  
- Failure of recall in elderly patients  
- Why artificial eyes cannot form memories without attention mechanisms

# 1. Core Thesis

All conscious perception and all memory formation require **spike amplitude above three thresholds**:
Motor_Threshold < Awareness_Threshold < Memory_Threshold

Thus:

- If spike amplitude > Motor_Threshold → Reflexive action possible  
- If spike amplitude > Awareness_Threshold → Conscious perception arises  
- If spike amplitude > Memory_Threshold → Memory formation & recall occur  

If amplitude drops below any threshold, the corresponding function collapses.

# 2. Why Spike Amplitude Falls  
(Cortical Surface-Tension Theory – CSTT)

The cortex behaves like a stretched sheet whose tension supports spike amplitude.

When cortical surface tension decreases:

Spike_Amplitude ↓
Signal-to-Noise Ratio ↓
Synchrony ↓
Qualia_Binding ↓
Memory_Indexing ↓

Causes of reduced tension include:

- stroke  
- trauma  
- metabolic shock  
- aging  
- long-term stress  
- sudden excessive absorption of neural energy  
- neurodegenerative changes  

Aging → brain surface loosens (exactly like skin), lowering spike amplitude globally.

# 3. Why Consciousness Fails Before Action

Motor pathways require **lowest amplitude** and **minimal synchrony**.

Awareness requires **high synchrony** across:
- V1–V4 streams  
- inferotemporal cortex  
- fronto-parietal attention system  

Thus during spike attenuation:

Action remains
Perception collapses
Memory disappears

This is the mechanism behind:
- blindsight  
- hemineglect  
- unconscious orienting  
- elderly patients “recognizing but not remembering”

# 4. Attention = Energy Allocation System  
Not a cognitive decision

Attention is not thinking.  
Attention is **allocation of spike amplitude to specific features**.

If attention is absent:

Feature_Specific_Amplitude < Memory_Threshold
→ No memory formation

Thus even with perfect vision:
- a distracted person fails to form memory  
- blindsight cannot form memory  
- hemineglect cannot form memory  
- artificial eyes cannot form memory  

Attention is a **biophysical gating mechanism**, not a psychological one.

---

# 5. Why Memory Recall Also Fails

Memory recall requires **reactivation** above the same threshold used during encoding.

If amplitude in old age is lower:

Spike_Amplitude_recall < Memory_Threshold
→ Memory not accessible

This explains:
- elderly forget names  
- elderly recall only after cues (external amplitude boost)  
- elderly recognize faces without recalling details  
- “tip-of-the-tongue” states  

Encoding and recall both require the same amplitude window.

---

# 6. Why Artificial Eyes Cannot Produce Memory

Artificial stimulation →  
no attention gating →  
no feature selection →  
no hippocampal indexing →  
no episodic memory.

Even perfect images injected into the cortex will fail because:

Memory = Amplitude + Attention + Hippocampal Indexing

Thus:
- artificial vision without attention → NO MEMORY  
- IR-based stimulation → neuronal overheating + cancer risk  
- continuous high-energy input → long-term cortical damage  

Any system bypassing attention is neurologically unsafe.

# 7. Blindsight & Memory: A Unified Equation

Represent spike amplitude as `A`.

Let:
- MT = Motor_Threshold  
- AT = Awareness_Threshold  
- HT = Memory_Threshold  

Then:

If A < MT → No action, no awareness
If MT ≤ A < AT → Blindsight action only
If AT ≤ A < HT → Awareness without memory
If A ≥ HT → Full conscious perception + memory

This one equation models:
- blindsight  
- hemineglect  
- aging memory loss  
- attention-based memory  
- artificial eye memory failure  

This is the first unified explanation requiring **no new assumptions**.

# 8. Therapeutic Implications

### ✓ 1. Memory Loss (Age Related)
Surface tension decline → spike amplitude decline → recall failure.

Intervention:
- spike-boosting electrical microarrays  
- frequency-specific cortical entrainment  
- re-tensioning neurostimulation protocols  
- external amplitude amplification (non-invasive E-field)  

### ✓ 2. Blindsight Restoration
Not by synthetic images, but by:

Amplifying endogenous spikes above Awareness_Threshold.

When this occurs:
- qualia reappear  
- conscious visual field returns  
- memory formation resumes  

### ✓ 3. Neglect Correction
Boost parietal spikes on neglected hemisphere → restore awareness of that half-space.

# 9. Summary

The spike-amplitude model explains:

✓ Why blindsight “sees without seeing”  
✓ Why hemineglect patients ignore half the world  
✓ Why elderly lose memory and recall  
✓ Why attention is required for memory formation  
✓ Why artificial eyes cannot produce memory  
✓ Why overstimulation (IR) damages cortex  
✓ Why conscious perception fails while motor responses survive  

All through **one physiological mechanism**:

Consciousness and memory are amplitude-dependent processes.
Awareness is not lost — amplitude is.
