1. Design Principle

Not neural replacement.
Not direct stimulation.

Instead:

> A passive-assist system that amplifies naturally generated neural signals.



This respects the brain’s intrinsic computational structure.

2. Core Components

High-density electrode array

Adaptive gain amplifiers

Machine-learning module for phase-coherent boosting

No artificial spike injection



---

3. Why It Works

Weak cortical spikes (due to aging/stress/injury) are:

Present

Structured

But too weak for conscious access


Boosting restores:

Sensory salience

Perceptual awareness

Memory recall pathways



---

4. Ethical Safety

Since the system does not overwrite neural pathways,
and only reinforces native signals,
it poses minimal cognitive risk.
