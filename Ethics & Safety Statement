## Ethics and Safety Statement

### 1. Scope of the Work

This work presents a **conceptual, non-invasive neurostimulation framework**
intended for academic discussion and future research evaluation.

It does not constitute a clinical device, medical recommendation,
or treatment protocol.

---

### 2. Non-Invasiveness and Harm Minimization

The proposed VISTA-T framework:
- Avoids surgical implantation
- Avoids infrared or thermal exposure
- Operates within current ranges comparable to established non-invasive neuromodulation techniques
- Does not introduce artificial percepts or override natural cognition

The design philosophy prioritizes biological compatibility and reversibility.

---

### 3. Respect for Neural Autonomy

VISTA-T does not:
- Inject information into the brain
- Bypass attention or salience mechanisms
- Override volitional control
- Alter identity, memory, or behavior

It only compensates for insufficient spike intensity where endogenous signals already exist.

---

### 4. Risk Awareness

Potential risks common to any non-invasive neurostimulation approach include:
- Transient discomfort
- Headache
- Fatigue
- Temporary sensory changes

These risks must be evaluated in controlled research environments
with appropriate oversight.

---

### 5. Clinical Boundary Conditions

The approach is **not applicable** in cases of:
- Complete destruction of primary visual cortex
- Absence of visual signal generation
- Severe neurodegenerative conditions without residual cortical function

---

### 6. Ethical Position on Human Trials

Any future human application must:
- Receive institutional ethical approval
- Follow informed consent protocols
- Include independent safety monitoring
- Begin with conservative parameter limits

The author explicitly discourages unauthorized experimentation.

---

### 7. Open Science Commitment

This work is released under an open license to:
- Prevent monopolization
- Prevent unsafe proprietary acceleration
- Encourage transparent peer scrutiny
- Ensure public accountability

Open access is treated as a **safety feature**, not merely a licensing choice.

---

### 8. Conflict of Interest

The author declares no financial interest, commercial intent,
or institutional affiliation related to this work.
