1. Introduction

Age-related memory decline is routinely attributed to neurodegeneration, neurotransmitter deficits, or hippocampal shrinkage.
While these factors contribute, they do not fully explain the uniformity and progression pattern observed across individuals.

We propose a biophysical mechanism:

> Gradual reduction in cortical surface tension with age reduces neuronal spike amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio, impairing both memory formation and memory recall.

2. Core Hypothesis: Cortical Surface Tension Decline

2.1 Biological justification

The brain, like skin and connective tissue, undergoes loss of mechanical stiffness and elasticity.

This leads to a reduction in the ability of cortical columns to maintain spike amplitude coherence.


2.2 Electrical implication

Lower surface tension ⇒

Reduced firing intensity

Reduced synchronization across sensory circuits

Weaker propagation toward hippocampal encoding pathways


This results in:

(a) Poor memory formation
(b) Poor memory recall, even when stored engrams are intact

3. Why This Explains Blindsight-like Phenomena in Normal Aging

Although true blindsight is lesion-driven, a milder analog arises naturally when:

Visual signals reach behavior circuits

But fail to reach conscious perception circuits

Because spike intensity is insufficient for cortical awareness


This is why older individuals can:

Avoid obstacles

React to visual cues
yet still say, “I didn’t see it properly.”

4. Why This Explains Memory Recall Problems

Hippocampal recall requires:

> Reactivation of the same cortical pattern with sufficient spike intensity.



If intensity falls below threshold:

Memory exists but cannot be accessed

Leading to the subjective feeling of “tip of the tongue” or blankness

5. Practical Non-Invasive Solution

A simple principle:

> Externally boosting cortical spike amplitude restores both perception intensity and recall.



This can be done using:

High-resolution electrode arrays

Non-invasive trans-scalp stimulation tuned to localized cortical modules

Low-current signal amplification (not replacement)


This avoids artificial stimulation and only reinforces existing neural signals.
