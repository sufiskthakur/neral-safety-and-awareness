# Open Neurovisual Signal Augmentation Framework

## Overview

This repository hosts open, non-invasive conceptual research frameworks
focused on restoring functional perception by amplifying subthreshold
neural activity — without introducing artificial information or invasive procedures.

All work is released under the MIT License to prevent proprietary misuse
and ensure accessibility for public-good research.

## Projects Included

### 1. HTVN (Hybrid Thalamocortical Visual Neuroprosthesis)
A systems-level architecture addressing safety, attention mediation,
and cortical stability in artificial vision research.

### 2. VISTA-T
**Visual Intensity Spike Threshold Amplifier – Transcranial**

A non-invasive, external, hearing-aid–like device concept designed
specifically for:

- Blindsight
- Hemineglect

VISTA-T operates by selectively boosting insufficient cortical spike
intensity in the primary visual cortex (V1), without generating new
visual information or bypassing natural pathways.

## Core Principle

> Loss of perception does not always imply loss of signal.
> In many cases, it reflects insufficient neuronal intensity.

VISTA-T restores perception by elevating endogenous neural activity
above conscious thresholds while preserving natural encoding.
