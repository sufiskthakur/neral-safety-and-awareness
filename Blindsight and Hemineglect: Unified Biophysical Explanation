1. Conventional Models Are Insufficient

Current neuroscience attributes blindsight to V1 damage and hemineglect to parietal lesions.
However, these explanations fail to capture:

Residual awareness

Rapid partial recovery

Variation depending on stress or metabolic load



---

2. Proposed Mechanism

A sudden localized drop in cortical surface tension causes:

Sharp decline in spike intensity

Failure of sensory data to cross conscious perception threshold

Preservation of dorsal-stream reflexive behavior


Thus:

Patient can act correctly

But cannot consciously perceive


This matches blindsight and hemineglect phenomenology.

3. Why Spikes Fail to Reach Awareness

Conscious vision requires:

> High-amplitude, coherent spike assemblies.



When intensity collapses:

Sensory routing → YES

Reflexive behavior → YES

Conscious perception → NO


Hence the paradoxical behavior.

4. Recovery Mechanism

As cortical tension partially returns (hours to weeks):

Spike amplitude increases

Conscious perception gradually returns
without any structural regeneration.


This explains highly variable recovery timelines.

5. Intervention

External signal boosting via high-density electrode arrays can immediately:

Amplify weak sensory circuits

Restore awareness

Without modifying neural connections
