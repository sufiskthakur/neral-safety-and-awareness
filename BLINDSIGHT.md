Physiological Basis of Blindsight  
Version 1.0

Blindsight appears paradoxical: individuals respond to visual stimuli without consciously seeing them.  
This document explains the condition using the Cortical Surface-Tension Theory (CSTT) and spike-attenuation model.

# 1. What Blindsight Is — and What It Is Not

Blindsight is not:
- damage to the eye  
- failure of optic nerve transmission  
- loss of all visual pathways  

Blindsight **is**:
- preserved dorsal-stream orienting  
- absence of V1-driven conscious synthesis  
- spike amplitude falling below the “awareness threshold”  

Thus the patient can:
- navigate around obstacles  
- point correctly toward stimuli  
- detect motion and direction  
But cannot:
- *see*  
- form visual memory  
- experience subjective vision

# 2. CSTT Explanation: Surface Tension → Spike Amplitude

The cortex behaves like a tensioned sheet.  
When surface tension declines (mechanical, metabolic, or lesion-driven):

Spike_Amplitude ↓
Signal-to-Noise Ratio ↓
Awareness_Threshold ↑ (relative effect)

If the spike amplitude drops **below** the threshold for conscious synthesis:

Perception = 0
Action_Capacity ≠ 0

Hence blindsight.

# 3. Why Dorsal Vision Survives

Blindsight patients retain:

- superior colliculus reflex circuits  
- pulvinar-driven motion responses  
- dorsal spatial-orienting pathways  

These pathways require **lower spike amplitude** for activation and do not perform conscious synthesis.

If Spike > Motor_Threshold and Spike < Awareness_Threshold: → Action without Awareness

This matches all blindsight behaviors.

# 4. Why Conscious Vision Fails

Conscious perception requires a *stable, energetic, synchronous spike assembly* across:

- V1 → V2 → V4  
- Inferotemporal cortex  
- Fronto-parietal attention loop  

When CSTT drops suddenly (stroke, trauma, metabolic shock):

Synchrony lost
Amplitude insufficient
Binding fails
→ No visual qualia

The eyes function normally; the awareness network does not.

# 5. Memory Formation Fails Completely

Even if the stimulus enters dorsal pathways:

- It never reaches hippocampal indexing  
- It never passes attention gating  
- It never forms episodic or semantic visual memory  

Thus blindsight patients:
- cannot recall what they "saw"  
- cannot learn new visual associations  
- cannot describe shapes or colors  

Correct motor responses occur **without** memory.

# 6. Hemineglect: Same Mechanism, Different Location

Hemineglect = spatial blindsight of half the world.  
Caused by CSTT collapse in right parietal cortex.

Patient can:
- eat food from one side  
- shave one side  
- avoid obstacles on neglected side reflexively  

But cannot:
- acknowledge that side visually  
- report anything present in that half of space  

Mechanism identical:

Spike amplitude insufficient for awareness
Sufficient for reflexive orienting

# 7. Restoring Conscious Vision

Blindsight is fundamentally a **signal-strength** problem, not perception loss.

A safe theoretical method of restoration:

1. Read subthreshold spikes with dense EEG/ECoG arrays  
2. Amplify only endogenous activity  
3. Feed back into the same cortical sheet  
4. Restore spike amplitude above awareness threshold  
5. Natural vision re-emerges  

This approach preserves:
- attention gating  
- memory formation pathways  
- natural timing  
- endogenous signal structure  

It avoids all synthetic sensory injection.

# 8. Summary

**Blindsight = awareness failure, not vision failure.**  
The CSTT model unifies:

✓ blindsight  
✓ hemineglect  
✓ preserved motor reactions  
✓ missing qualia  
✓ absent visual memory  
✓ inconsistent subjective reporting  

through a **single physiological principle**:

Conscious awareness requires spike amplitude above the awareness threshold. Action requires far less.

This makes blindsight the clearest demonstration of the CNS operating with:
- preserved unconscious processing  
- absent conscious synthesis  

A unified, testable, non-invasive explanatory model.
